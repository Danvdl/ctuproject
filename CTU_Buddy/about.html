                       Hi I'm Freek Schaefer
                       I went to Swellendam High School. I was swim Captain for my school and I was the fastest 
                       swimmer in my school during my time as captain. My favorite subjects was IGO "drawings" and CAT. 
                       I always aimed to be the best in my class. My favorite quote is " To be the best at anytinhg you do".
                       For this project I created the CSS file to ensure that the website looks good. I also integrated the
                       CSS into the program and made sure that it works correctly.
                    </p>

                       I went to Point high school in Mossel Bay. I was part of the Esport gaming team in my school and my favorite Subject is math 
                       I love programming and that is why I worked on this website. My role in this project was to do the wireframe for most of the pages
                       and to program the head tags on every page, adding meta data and links.
                    </p>

                       I went to an Agricultural school where we were taught how to do practical work. This allowed me to see the importance of automation.
                       I learned how to program after matric and used this knowledge to create a few programs. This website is a big deal for me beacuse
                       it will be used to give students an easier way to study and get the material they need. My role in this project to ensure that the JavaScript
                       is functional and that it is correctly integrated into the website. I also did the wireframe for a few of the pages.
